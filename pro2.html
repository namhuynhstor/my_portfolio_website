									<h2 class="major">Brief about the project</h2>
									<p> The project will be based on the area of Southeast Asian, called S.E.A</p>
									<p>In this project, I will use SQL Server to explore data on Covid-19 in Southeast Asian nations (Brunei, Myanmar, Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam). Following the exploration, I will visualize the data in Tableau.</p>
									<p>The project will be divided into two sections, the first of which will be <b>Data Exploration</b> and the second of which will be <b>Data Visualization</b>.</p>
									
								<div class="inner">
									<h2 class="major">About dataset</h2>
									<p>Our World in Data contributed the data. From early 2020 until the present, the dataset provides the worldwide coronavirus pandemic report. All data for this study is maintained in two tables: 'CovidDeaths' and 'CovidVaccinations' with the former including information about infection and fatalities and the latter containing information on vaccines.</p>
									<p>Please keep in mind that the dataset is updated everyday. This project's data is current as of June 23, 2023.</p>

								<div class="inner">
									   <h2 class="major">Process Planning</h2>
									   <b>Step 1:</b> Download full data (.csv) from Our World in Data.<br> 
										<b>Step 2:</b> Run the csv file with Excel and perform data sorting and splitting to <b>'CovidDeaths'</b> and <b>'CovidVaccinations'</b>.<br> 
										<b>Step 3:</b> Import those in SQL Server do ETL(Extract, Transform, Load).<br> 
										<b>Step 4:</b> Download Tableau Public (Free) or Tableau Desktop (14 days trial) to perform Data Analysis. <br> 
										<b>Step 5:</b> Connect Tableau with SQL Server database or Excel database. <br> 
										<b>Step 6:</b> Save the file as (.twb or .twbx).</p>

</code></pre>

<P>I've built a temporary database named CovidSEA that contains only SEA countries and columns that I'll use in the investigation by linking the CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations tables together.</P>
<p>The CASE WHEN method was also used to generate a new column called'region', which would designate whether the nation is located in Mainland SEA or Maritime SEA. </p>
<p>Furthermore, I use the Window Function (PARTITION BY clause) to split the number of vaccines into partitions and then use the SUM() function on each subset of partitioned data, which in this case is partitioned by location column, to get the total number of vaccinations for each country.</p>

<p>&rarr; By 23 June 2023, a significant milestone had been achieved in Southeast Asia, with 78% of the population having received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, while 70% of the population had completed their vaccination journey. It is worth mentioning that the utilization of the WITH clause has played a crucial role in organizing and streamlining lengthy and intricate hierarchical queries, contributing to improved efficiency and readability.</p>

<p>&rarr; Interestingly, Brunei has the highest vaccination rate, but from the previous queries, Brunei also has second highest percent of infected population. This might be because of Brunei has a relatively small population, which allows for easier logistics and distribution of vaccines. The country's well-established healthcare infrastructure and effective communication channels have also facilitated the vaccination process.</p>						


<h3>** Comparison between Mainland SEA and Maritime SEA</h3>
<b>NOTE:</b> 
	<li>Mainland SEA is including Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam.</li>

<p>&rarr; In terms of various aspects, the Maritime Southeast Asia (SEA) region exhibits higher numbers compared to the Mainland SEA region. This difference can be attributed to the fact that the population of the Maritime SEA region is nearly double that of the Mainland SEA region, approximately 1.7 times larger.</p>
